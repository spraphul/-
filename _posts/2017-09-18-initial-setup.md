Hey guys, Its Praphul. Are you a Kanpurite?. If Yes, You are at right site. I remained a student of class XI and XII from
C.B.S.E board in Kanpur in Guru Nanak Public School. I also prepared there
for IIT JEE in Kakadeo and I want to keep the
memories of these three years ever alive. The
memories which perhaps can never be regained. The friends, the teachers, the
hostels and the city(What a enjoyous and lovely life it was!). Here, I understood what life really means. I learnt here to learn practically and
in true words I am not gonna let them go from my life...

The second reason for this long blog is to make the students of kanpur
realise what one needs to do when there is a dream to fulfill and what it feels
when things do not happen to your expectations.

So, finally wasting no more lines and dedicating those to my Parents, my
brother, my teachers, and some of my best friends
Deepak, Dhanraj, Dilip,Gaurav(Puri), Utkarsh,Sajal, kushagra, Manish
Bhaia, Krishna bhaia , Dharmveer and many more, here we go...

### First Step In The City
It was 15th of May 2012 when after saying a bitter good bye to my family in a small
town Nichlaul, I left for Kanpur all alone with
nothing in my hand but just a bag having some clothes piled inside and of
course an ATM card too.I arrived Kanpur central(CNB) at 11 in the night.
Took an auto and reached Rawatpur Crossing where my friend Alok
Mishra received me and then we walked off to his hostel. In the way, I saw a
large shining building with brightening posters on it and then came to know that
it was Rave Moti, a shopping mall and this was the first time I was introduced
to the kind of world. In fact, it was the first time I entered a hostel room whose
owner was so weird that I couldn't handle him too far. Mishra Ji was from
Nichlaul too and was there to prepare for the famous IIT JEE. I was really
very confused about where to take admission for coachings and all. Kakadeo, a well-known market for coachings (called coaching mandi in hindi)
and was a hard place to trust upon. I stayed there for 3 days roaming around
the streets, visiting JK temple which was a like a lover’s
point rather than a temple and perphaps it was so because it was the temple
of Lord Krishna(You Know what I mean), visiting the air conditioned mall(first time bro). And then
finally I told Mishra Ji to take me to his Physics Class, QUARK(Notice the name). I went there, It was a very small insti and I was very much decisive
at the moment. There, I met Mr. Anant Agnihotri, My Physics Guru to
whom I darely asked, “ Sir, Please tell me whether Physics of school level or
IIT JEE level is tought here?”
He smiled as he understood my situation and the doubtful expression on my
face. He said, “Dear, First you should take one or more classes and then
decide. Afterall we start from the basics and then eventually reach the real
height of IIT JEE.”
From the next day, I started my first class of Mechanics and was pleased I was at the right place. But still the task was not over and it was time to choose a teacher for Mathematics and Chemistry. I
was told to join the coaching of M. Sahvan for maths and G.D Verma for
Chemistry. When I entered the classroom for maths and was just startled
seeing the environment there. I was from a small town and there in Kanpur
the classes were centrally air-conditioned, students seemed to be very
smart. In the class, the teacher asked the students whether the results of class Xth of
C.B.S.E board has come or not. The answer was positive. Almost 50%
students got 10 CGPA and a very few like me were in the crowd getting 9
CGPA. I thought that the competition is really going to be very tough here.
After taking the class, I finally decided to take admission in the foundation
batch(just name). I called my Father and asked him to come with all the goods. The next
day I searched out for a room and after a long struggle in the sunny day, I
managed to get one and My Father and brother were there by the
evening. Father met Anant sir and said me, “We have great hopes from you.”(very little did he say)
And then returned.
Now the time was to take admission in school. I wanted a school where
attendance was not a mandatory stuff.
But searching for such a school with vacant seats really proved to be a tough deal the new city. I went for many schools like Virendra swaroop,
M.P.E.C, Jugaldevi, KVs, and Puranchand  but not a single one was there
with a vacant seat.
I also went to Sir Padampat Singhania School. It was a nice school just
behind the famous JK temple and was a dummy one too but all my hopes
washed away when I heard the amount of fees required for the admission. For
many of you the amount would be acceptable but not for a boy like me from a middle-class family. It
literally burnt a hole in my Pocket.
I was really very worried those days and one day I met a boy, Deepak
Gangwani in the Chemistry class. He looked like a ***champu*** but now-a-days(to my surprise) he has become a handsome hunk with
so many girls around him. He sat besides me and asked, “ how much did you
get in the test?”

“56/96”, I said.
“OK, Mine is 66”, he said (don’t know why, a show off kinda thing). He annoyed me at that moment as I was in a bad situation of fear of not
getting admission in a school.
But this guy proved to be a great friend of mine. I had no friend with such
loyalty before.
Then he proceeded and asked about me and knowing that I was an outsider
and was seeking for admission in class XI, he asked me to give the entrance
in Guru Nanak Public school with him.
Then in the next class, I met another idiot, Gaurav Puri. He was though a
miser one but great at heart.
We became friends and afterward he told me that GNPS is a missionary
school but attendance is compulsory there. But I had no choice. Then with no
delay I along with Deepak and my brother took admission there.

### First day at school

My first day at school was also quite interesting because it was the day when I
met some people who are more like brothers to me now and some who
played the role of bones in the flesh for me too.

We had initially no school dress and we all got white dresses and entered the
school. Students were staring us like we were some kind of corpses in the
crowd of livings .Their boggalled eyes were confusing us a lot but we put on
our own way.
In every 45 minutes a new teacher was coming and we were introduced with
their unique styles. But the most interesting entry was of my English Teacher,
Shakti Ma’am.  As the name suggests she had great power in her hand too and
that I got to know after some days. She entered the class and shouted
loudly, “ Listen everyone, as the classes are being held since the month of
April and many chapters have been taught, so I am not going to repeat them
all.”
Her rudeness thrilled me, I don’t know about others. But a contrasting fact is
that she was impressed by me the most. And I obviously had no problem. Afterall she
was not an old lady. Yeah she did a lot for me too as she used to give me full marks
in vivas even if I didn’t attend any and much more.

I used to go school alternately and almost everytime gave the same reason for
the absence. My class teacher whom I hated the most in XI understood my
evils completely and after that everyday I went school, I was punished and
was kept outside the class for the first two periods.
Eventually I also started enjoying the free periods. Now in the first unit test,
I got merely 50% marks which was out of the range of my imaginations. For
the first year , I had no attachment for the school, I swear.
